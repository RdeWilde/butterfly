## Starting this example

1. Download Packages - `pub get`
2. Install the webdev tool - `pub global activate webdev`
3. Run the dev client with `webdev serve`
4. Run the dev server with `dart --observe web/todo_dev.dart`
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/web/todo_dev.html`
  - (this is the port used by the dev serve, not the dev client)
6. Hot reload can be triggered from observatory.  Possibly by command too?
