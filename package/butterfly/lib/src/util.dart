/// Dart VM implements `identical` as true reference identity. JavaScript does
/// not have this. The closest we have in JS is `===`. However, for strings JS
/// would actually compare the contents rather than references. `dart2js`
/// compiles `identical` to `===` and therefore there is a discrepancy between
/// Dart VM and `dart2js`. The implementation of `looseIdentical` attempts to
/// bridge the gap between the two while retaining good performance
/// characteristics. In JS we use simple `identical`, which compiles to `===`,
/// and in Dart VM we emulate the semantics of `===` by special-casing strings.
/// Note that the VM check is a compile-time constant. This allows `dart2js` to
/// evaluate the conditional during compilation and inline the entire function.
///
/// See: dartbug.com/22496, dartbug.com/25270
